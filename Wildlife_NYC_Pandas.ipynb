Some urban wildlife is native, like eastern grey squirrels, while some are non-native, like mute swans. Domesticated and companion animals, like dogs, exotic pets, and farm animals are not considered urban wildlife. Domesticated but feral animals like pigeons and stray cats are also not considered urban wildlife.\n",
